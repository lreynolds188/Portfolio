            Upon completion of my degree I plan to have a solid foundation in a range of differnet development
            languages and techniques, with a keen interest on cyber security, microsystems, and artificial intelligence.
            My hope is to work advancing the functionality, affordability, and sustainability of futuristic technological applications.
