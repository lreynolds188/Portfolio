            In 2020 I was the project manager for a university based start-up with the goal of implementing a cloud based portal for QUT. In 2018 and 2019 I was responsible for developing business applications and supporting the production environment of a large food processing plant. In 2016 I completed a Diploma of Software Development at Tafe Queensland and from 2012 to 2015 was employed as a Computer Technician.

            Upon completion of my degree I plan to have a solid foundation in a range of differnet development languages and techniques, with a keen interest on cyber security, microsystems, and artificial intelligence. My hope is to work advancing the functionality, affordability, and sustainability of futuristic technological applications.
