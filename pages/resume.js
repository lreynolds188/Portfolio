            I am a Computer Scientist and owner of <a href="https://automatedtechnicalsolutions.com">Automated Tech Solutions</a>&nbsp;
            a technical consulting firm based in Queensland, Australia.
            I currently have one subject remaining to receive my degree and am the sole member of my business
            working to implement infrastructure and build the customer base.
          </p><br /><br />
          <p className={styles.description}>
            In 2021 I was employed as a project and operations manager responsible for supporting the production environment 
            and implementing an IoT automation system for the company's primary reactor. 
            In 2020 I was the project manager for a university based start-up with the goal of implementing a cloud
            based portal for QUT. In 2018 and 2019 I was responsible for developing business applications and supporting
            the production environment of a large food processing plant. In 2016 I completed a Diploma of Software Development
            at Tafe Queensland and from 2012 to 2015 was employed as a Computer Technician.
          </p><br /><br />
          <p className={styles.description}>
            Upon completion of my degree I plan to have a solid foundation in a range of different development
            languages and techniques with a keen focus on cyber security, blockchain technology, and IoT automation devices. In addition to a
            basic foundation of mathematics, physics, business, psychology, and philosophy.
            My goal is to work toward advancing the functionality, affordability, and sustainability of futuristic technological applications.
